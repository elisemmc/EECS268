1. 
Minimum height of a tree with n nodes is log2(n+1) 
	note: the log is base 2 but I couldn't type it subscript.  

Maximum height of a tree with n nodes is n.
 	At this point, it is essentially a linked list.

2.
Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is 2^(h-1).
   
Minimum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is h nodes.

3.
Perfect binary tree: Binary tree with all leaves on the same level.

Full binary tree: Binary tree of height h with no missing nodes.  
All leaves are at level h and all other nodes have two children.

Complete binary tree: Binary tree of height h that is full to level h-1 and has level h filled from left to right.

Balanced binary tree: Binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of any node have heights that differ by at most 1.

Degenerate binary trees: A binary tree where most or all of the nodes have only one child.
This binary tree is unbalanced and in the worst case it acts as a linked list.

Binary tree and Binary search tree:
A binary tree is a tree with a maximum of two child nodes per parent node.

A binary search tree is a binary tree where all items in the left subtree are less than the parent node and greater than the parent node in the right subtree.
